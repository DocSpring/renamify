title: Renaming Ourselves to Renamify
description: How I used this tool to rename the project to something else
---

The original name for this took was "Refaktor". I decided that "Renamify" would
be a better name, because it's more about renaming thing and less about
refactoring.

We used a `.rfignore` file to exclude certain files from our end-to-end tests,
so I needed to delete that first.

Next, I ran this command:

```bash
./target/release/refaktor rename refaktor renamify
```

This renamed almost everything in one shot:

```diff

Renamify excludes dotfiles by default, so I also had to run it on some specific
dotfiles and directories:

```bash
./target/release/refaktor rename refaktor renamify \
    .github/ .taskmaster/ .gitignore
```

```diff

Finally, I needed to rename the `.rfignore` (For **r**e**f**actor) file to
`.rnignore` (for **r**e**n**amify):

```bash
./target/release/refaktor rename rfignore rnignore
```

```diff

All that was left to do was rename the GitHub repository and the project
directory. Then I committed and pushed to the new repo.
