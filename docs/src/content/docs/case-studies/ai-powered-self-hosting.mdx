One of the most powerful features of Renamify is its ability to rename itself - a true test of any renaming tool. This case study shows how we used the Renamify MCP server with Claude to rename our case style identifiers from `LowerJoined` to `LowerFlat` and `UpperJoined` to `UpperFlat`.

## The Challenge

We had named our case styles `LowerJoined` and `UpperJoined` to describe identifiers with no separators (like `flatcase` and `UPPERFLATCASE`). We realized these should be called `LowerFlat` and `UpperFlat` to match the standard naming convention.

This meant renaming:

- Rust enum variants in the core library
- CLI argument names (kebab-case versions: `lower-joined` → `lower-flat`)
- Documentation across multiple `.mdx` files
- Test files with both PascalCase and kebab-case variants

## The Solution: AI + MCP

Instead of manually searching and replacing across all these contexts, we used Claude Code with the Renamify MCP server. The AI agent simply called the `renamify_rename` tool twice:

### First Rename: LowerJoined → LowerFlat

```
renamify_rename(old: "LowerJoined", new: "LowerFlat", preview: "summary")

[PLAN SUMMARY]
Search: LowerJoined
Replace: LowerFlat
Matches: 16
Files: 7
Paths: 0

[CONTENT]
docs/src/content/docs/commands/search.mdx: 2 matches [lower-joined: 2]
docs/src/content/docs/features/case-transformations.mdx: 1 matches [lower-joined: 1]
docs/src/content/docs/mcp/tools.mdx: 1 matches [lower-joined: 1]
renamify-cli/src/cli/args.rs: 1 matches [lower-joined: 1]
renamify-cli/src/cli/types.rs: 3 matches [LowerJoined: 3]
renamify-cli/tests/case_style_filtering.rs: 7 matches [LowerJoined: 2, lower-joined: 5]
renamify-core/src/case_model.rs: 1 matches [LowerJoined: 1]

✓ Applied 16 replacements across 7 files
Undo with: renamify undo 3d6fffa278df81c5
```

### Second Rename: UpperJoined → UpperFlat

```
renamify_rename(old: "UpperJoined", new: "UpperFlat", preview: "summary")

[PLAN SUMMARY]
Search: UpperJoined
Replace: UpperFlat
Matches: 9
Files: 6
Paths: 0

[CONTENT]
docs/src/content/docs/commands/search.mdx: 2 matches [upper-joined: 2]
docs/src/content/docs/features/case-transformations.mdx: 1 matches [upper-joined: 1]
docs/src/content/docs/mcp/tools.mdx: 1 matches [upper-joined: 1]
renamify-cli/src/cli/args.rs: 1 matches [upper-joined: 1]
renamify-cli/src/cli/types.rs: 3 matches [UpperJoined: 3]
renamify-core/src/case_model.rs: 1 matches [UpperJoined: 1]

✓ Applied 9 replacements across 6 files
Undo with: renamify undo 190723b349dc27a4
```

## What Got Renamed

In a single operation, Renamify automatically handled:

1. **Rust code**: `LowerJoined` → `LowerFlat` (PascalCase enum variants)
2. **CLI arguments**: `lower-joined` → `lower-flat` (kebab-case)
3. **Documentation**: Updated all references in `.mdx` files
4. **Test files**: Both PascalCase identifiers and kebab-case strings

The tool understood the context and applied the appropriate case transformation:

- PascalCase in Rust enums
- kebab-case in CLI help text and arguments
- Both forms in test files

## Why This Matters

This demonstrates several key advantages of using Renamify with AI:

1. **Context awareness**: The tool correctly identified and transformed all case variants
2. **Safety**: Changes were atomic - all or nothing
3. **Undo support**: Each operation provided an undo ID for instant rollback
4. **AI integration**: Claude understood the tool's output and executed both renames sequentially
5. **Self-hosting**: A renaming tool that can safely rename itself is a strong validation

## The Result

25 replacements across 13 files in seconds, with perfect case transformation throughout:

- Documentation stayed consistent
- CLI arguments updated correctly
- Rust code compiled without errors
- Tests passed without modification

All with two simple MCP tool calls from an AI agent.
