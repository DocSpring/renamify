## Overview

Atomic identifiers allow you to treat compound brand names and identifiers as indivisible units during case transformations. When an identifier is marked as atomic, Renamify preserves it as a single word without detecting internal word boundaries.

This feature is essential for maintaining brand identity and preventing incorrect word splitting in compound names like "DocSpring" or "GitHub".

## The Problem

Without atomic mode, compound identifiers are split at word boundaries:

```bash
# Without atomic mode
DocSpring → doc_spring (snake_case)
DocSpring → doc-spring (kebab-case)
DocSpring → DOC_SPRING (SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE)
```

These transformations break the brand identity and can cause issues when the name should remain as a single unit.

## The Solution

With atomic identifiers, compound identifiers are preserved as single units:

```bash
# With atomic mode
DocSpring → docspring (snake_case)
DocSpring → docspring (kebab-case)
DocSpring → DOCSPRING (SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE)
DocSpring → DocSpring (PascalCase - preserved)
```

## With Atomic Identifiers

### Command Line Flags

You can enable atomic identifiers using CLI flags:

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Both atomic">
  ```bash
  # Both search and replace terms are atomic
  renamify rename FormAPI DocSpring --atomic-identifiers
  ```
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Search only">
  ```bash
  # Only search term is atomic
  renamify rename FormAPI Helper --atomic-search
  ```
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Replace only">

```bash
# Only replace term is atomic
renamify rename OldName DocSpring --atomic-replace
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Configuration File

You can configure commonly used atomic identifiers in `.renamify/config.toml`:

```toml
# List of identifiers that should always be treated as atomic
atomic = ["DocSpring", "GitHub", "FormAPI"]
```

When configured identifiers are detected, they're automatically treated as atomic without needing CLI flags.

### Overriding Configuration

You can override the configuration file settings:

```bash
# Override config to allow word boundaries
renamify rename DocSpring doc_spring --no-atomic-search

# Override for search term only
renamify rename DocSpring Helper --no-atomic-search

# Override for replace term only
renamify rename OldName DocSpring --no-atomic-replace
```

## Real-World Examples

### Renaming a Brand Name

When renaming "FormAPI" to "DocSpring" with atomic mode:

```bash
renamify rename FormAPI DocSpring --atomic-identifiers
```

Results:

- `FormAPIController` → `DocSpringController`
- `formapi_client` → `docspring_client`
- `FORMAPI_TOKEN` → `DOCSPRING_TOKEN`
- `useFormAPIHook` → `useDocSpringHook`

### Partial Matching

Atomic identifiers are preserved even when they appear as part of larger identifiers:

```bash
# GitHub is atomic
GitHubActions → GitHubActions (preserved in PascalCase)
github_api → github_api (preserved as single unit)
GITHUB_TOKEN → GITHUB_TOKEN (preserved as single unit)
```

## Case Transformation Behavior

When an identifier is atomic, case transformations follow these rules:

| Case Style           | Non-Atomic | Atomic    |
| -------------------- | ---------- | --------- |
| snake_case           | doc_spring | docspring |
| kebab-case           | doc-spring | docspring |
| camelCase            | docSpring  | docspring |
| PascalCase           | DocSpring  | DocSpring |
| SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE | DOC_SPRING | DOCSPRING |
| Train-Case           | Doc-Spring | Docspring |
| lowercase            | docspring  | docspring |
| UPPERCASE            | DOCSPRING  | DOCSPRING |

## VS Code Extension

The VS Code extension provides checkboxes for atomic mode:

- **Atomic search**: Treat the search term as an indivisible unit
- **Atomic replace**: Treat the replace term as an indivisible unit

These checkboxes include tooltips explaining their behavior and are automatically checked when terms match configured atomic identifiers.

## Best Practices

1. **Configure Common Brand Names**: Add frequently used brand names to your `.renamify/config.toml`
2. **Use for Compound Words**: Apply atomic mode to compound brand names and technical terms that should remain unified
3. **Consider Context**: Use atomic mode when the identifier's meaning depends on being a single unit
4. **Test First**: Use `--dry-run` to preview how atomic mode affects your renaming

## Technical Details

### How It Works

1. **Token Parsing**: When atomic mode is enabled, the identifier bypasses normal word boundary detection
2. **Variant Generation**: Only case variants are generated, not word-separated variants
3. **Pattern Matching**: The atomic identifier is matched and replaced as a complete unit

### Performance

Atomic mode has minimal performance impact:

- Detection happens during the parsing phase
- No additional scanning or regex operations required
- Config file is cached after first read

## Limitations

- Atomic mode applies to the entire identifier - you cannot make part of an identifier atomic
- Case-insensitive matching is used for configured atomic identifiers
- Atomic identifiers should not contain delimiters (underscores, hyphens, etc.)
