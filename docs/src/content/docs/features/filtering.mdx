title: Filtering and Ignore Rules
description:
  Control which files Renamify processes with includes, excludes, and ignore
  rules
---

Renamify provides powerful filtering options to control exactly which files get
processed during renaming operations.

## Default Behavior (Respects .gitignore and .ignore)

By default, Renamify respects standard ignore mechanisms:

- **`.gitignore` files** at all levels
- **`.git/info/exclude`** (repository-specific ignores)
- **Global git ignore rules** (`~/.gitignore_global`, etc.)
- **`.ignore` files** (generic convention used by ripgrep, fd, and other modern tools)
- **`.rnignore` files** (Renamify-specific ignore files)
- **Hidden files and directories** are **included** (like `.goreleaser.yaml`, `.github/`)
- **`.git` directory** is **always excluded** (never scanned or renamed)

This means Renamify won't process files in `node_modules/`, `target/`, etc. by
default, but **will** process hidden files like `.goreleaser.yaml` and `.github/workflows/`
that are tracked in your repository.

## Using .rnignore Files

Create a `.rnignore` file to exclude files from renaming without affecting your
`.gitignore` or `.ignore` files. This is useful for files that always need to preserve a specific term
even if it's being renamed everywhere else.

### Example .rnignore

```gitignore
# Exclude generated files from renaming
*.generated.ts
*_pb.go

# Exclude specific directories
vendor/
third_party/

# Exclude lock files
package-lock.json
Cargo.lock
```

### Precedence

`.rnignore` files work alongside other ignore files:

1. `.rnignore` - Renamify-specific exclusions
2. `.ignore` - Generic tool exclusions (ripgrep, fd, etc.)
3. `.gitignore` - Git version control exclusions
4. Global git ignore rules

Files matched by any of these will be excluded from renaming operations.

## Unrestricted Mode

Use ripgrep-style unrestricted flags to reduce filtering:

### `-u` (Unrestricted Level 1)

Disables `.gitignore` files but respects other ignore mechanisms:

```bash
renamify plan old_name new_name -u
```

- ✅ Processes files ignored by `.gitignore`
- ✅ Includes hidden files and directories
- ❌ Still respects `.git/info/exclude`, global git ignore, `.ignore`, and `.rnignore`
- ❌ Still excludes `.git` directory
- ❌ Still skips binary files

### `-uu` (Unrestricted Level 2)

Disables all ignore files:

```bash
renamify plan old_name new_name -uu
```

- ✅ Processes all ignore files (`.gitignore`, `.ignore`, `.rnignore`)
- ✅ Includes hidden files and directories
- ❌ Still excludes `.git` directory
- ❌ Still skips binary files

### `-uuu` (Unrestricted Level 3)

Processes everything, including binary files:

```bash
renamify plan old_name new_name -uuu
```

- ✅ Processes all files
- ✅ Includes hidden files and directories
- ✅ Treats binary files as text (dangerous!)
- ❌ Still excludes `.git` directory (always excluded for safety)

**⚠️ Warning**: Level 3 can corrupt binary files. Use with extreme caution.

## Include Patterns

Use glob patterns to specify exactly which files to process:

### Single Pattern

```bash
# Only process Rust source files
renamify plan old_name new_name --include "**/*.rs"

# Only process files in src/ directory
renamify plan old_name new_name --include "src/**"
```

### Multiple Patterns

```bash
# Process Rust and TypeScript files
renamify plan old_name new_name --include "**/*.rs,**/*.ts,**/*.tsx"

# Process specific directories
renamify plan old_name new_name --include "src/**,lib/**,tests/**"
```

## Exclude Patterns

Skip specific files or directories:

### Common Exclusions

```bash
# Exclude test files
renamify plan old_name new_name --exclude "**/*test*"

# Exclude build outputs and dependencies
renamify plan old_name new_name --exclude "target/**,node_modules/**,dist/**"

# Exclude specific file types
renamify plan old_name new_name --exclude "**/*.min.js,**/*.bundle.js"
```

### Combining Include and Exclude

```bash
# Process TypeScript files but skip tests and node_modules
renamify plan old_name new_name \
  --include "**/*.ts,**/*.tsx" \
  --exclude "**/*test*,node_modules/**"
```

## Exclude Specific Matches

Use `--exclude-match` to skip specific compound words or identifiers that match
your pattern but shouldn't be changed:

```bash
# Skip specific compound words that contain your pattern
renamify plan foo bar --exclude-match bazFooQux,FooService

# Useful when a pattern accidentally matches unintended identifiers
renamify rename config settings --exclude-match ConfigurationManager
```

This is particularly useful when:

- Your pattern matches part of a larger compound word
- Certain identifiers contain your pattern but have different meanings
- You want to be very selective about what gets changed

## Exclude Lines by Pattern

Use `--exclude-matching-lines` to filter out matches on lines that match a regex
pattern. This is perfect for skipping comments, TODO markers, or any other
line-level patterns:

### Skip Comments

```bash
# Skip C-style comment lines (starting with //)
renamify plan old_name new_name --exclude-matching-lines '^//'

# Skip Python/Shell comment lines (starting with #)
renamify plan old_name new_name --exclude-matching-lines '^\s*#'

# Skip both // and /* style comments
renamify plan old_name new_name --exclude-matching-lines '^\s*(//|/\*)'
```

### Skip TODO/FIXME Markers

```bash
# Skip lines containing TODO or FIXME
renamify plan old_name new_name --exclude-matching-lines '(TODO|FIXME)'

# Skip lines with any common code markers
renamify plan old_name new_name --exclude-matching-lines '(TODO|FIXME|HACK|NOTE|XXX)'
```

### Skip Debug or Test Code

```bash
# Skip lines containing DEBUG
renamify plan old_name new_name --exclude-matching-lines 'DEBUG'

# Skip console.log statements
renamify plan old_name new_name --exclude-matching-lines 'console\.(log|debug|error)'

# Skip test assertions
renamify plan old_name new_name --exclude-matching-lines '(assert|expect|test|describe)\('
```

### Advanced Patterns

```bash
# Skip Python linter directives
renamify plan old_name new_name --exclude-matching-lines '#.*(pylint|type:|noqa)'

# Skip JSDoc comments
renamify plan old_name new_name --exclude-matching-lines '^\s*\*'

# Skip lines with specific annotations
renamify plan old_name new_name --exclude-matching-lines '@(deprecated|internal|ignore)'
```

### Important Notes

- The regex matches against the **entire line** containing the match
- Use `^` to match from the start of the line
- The pattern is case-sensitive by default
- Invalid regex patterns will cause an error before scanning begins

This feature is particularly useful when:

- You want to preserve comments that reference old names
- You have TODO items mentioning future renames
- You want to exclude matches in debug/logging code
- You need to skip matches in specific code annotations

## Glob Pattern Syntax

Renamify uses standard glob patterns:

| Pattern   | Matches                                 |
| --------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `*`       | Any filename (not directories)          |
| `**`      | Any number of directories               |
| `?`       | Single character                        |
| `[abc]`   | Any character in brackets               |
| `[!abc]`  | Any character not in brackets           |
| `{a,b,c}` | Any of the comma-separated alternatives |

### Examples

```bash
# All JavaScript files recursively
"**/*.js"

# All files in src/ and lib/ directories
"{src,lib}/**"

# TypeScript files but not declaration files
"**/*.ts" --exclude "**/*.d.ts"

# Files starting with 'test' or 'spec'
"**/{test,spec}*"
```

## Binary File Handling

Renamify automatically detects and skips binary files by default:

### Detection Methods

- **File extension**: `.jpg`, `.png`, `.exe`, etc.
- **Content analysis**: Checks for null bytes and non-UTF8 content
- **Magic numbers**: Recognizes common binary file headers

### Override Binary Detection

```bash
# Force processing of all files (dangerous!)
renamify plan old_name new_name -uuu

# Include specific binary extensions (not recommended)
renamify plan old_name new_name --include "**/*.{bin,dat}"
```

## Auto-Initialization

Renamify automatically prompts to ignore its workspace directory on first use:

### Interactive Prompt

```
Renamify uses .renamify/ for plans, backups, and history.
Ignore it now?
  [Y] Repo .gitignore   [l] Local .git/info/exclude   [g] Global excludesfile   [n] No
Choice (Y/l/g/n):
```

### Command-Line Control

```bash
# Automatically add to .gitignore without prompting
renamify --auto-init=repo plan old new

# Prevent any auto-initialization
renamify --no-auto-init plan old new

# Use -y for non-interactive environments (CI)
renamify -y plan old new
```

## Performance Tips

### Optimize Large Codebases

```bash
# Be specific with includes to avoid scanning unnecessary files
renamify plan old new --include "src/**/*.{js,ts,tsx}"

# Exclude large directories early
renamify plan old new --exclude "node_modules/**,target/**,.git/**"
```

### Parallel Processing

Renamify automatically uses parallel directory traversal and file processing for
optimal performance on large codebases.

## Common Patterns

### Frontend Projects

```bash
# React/TypeScript project
renamify rename oldName newName \
  --include "src/**/*.{ts,tsx,js,jsx}" \
  --exclude "**/*.test.*,**/__tests__/**,node_modules/**"
```

### Rust Projects

```bash
# Rust project with tests
renamify rename old_name new_name \
  --include "**/*.rs" \
  --exclude "target/**"
```

### Python Projects

```bash
# Python with tests in separate directory
renamify rename old_name new_name \
  --include "**/*.py" \
  --exclude "venv/**,__pycache__/**,*.pyc"
```

### Documentation Only

```bash
# Only process markdown and text files
renamify rename old_name new_name \
  --include "**/*.{md,txt,rst}"
```
