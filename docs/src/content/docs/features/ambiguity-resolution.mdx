title: Resolving Case Ambiguity
description: How Renamify intelligently resolves ambiguous case styles
---

When renaming identifiers, Renamify sometimes encounters ambiguous cases where the same text could belong to multiple case styles. This guide explains how Renamify intelligently resolves these ambiguities.

## What is Case Ambiguity?

An identifier is ambiguous when it could validly belong to multiple case styles. For example:

- `api` - all lowercase, could be part of snake_case, camelCase, kebab-case, or just lowercase
- `ID` - all uppercase, could be PascalCase with an acronym, uppercase, or SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE
- `.config` - the word "config" after a dot could be various styles

## How Renamify Resolves Ambiguity

Renamify uses a sophisticated multi-level approach to resolve ambiguities, trying each strategy in order until a clear answer is found:

### 1. Language-Specific Conventions

For known programming languages, Renamify applies language-specific heuristics based on syntactic context.

**Ruby Example:**
```ruby
# "User" after "class" -> PascalCase expected
class User
end

# "API" after "module" -> PascalCase expected
# (using Active Support Inflections for acronyms)
module API
end
```

**Python Example:**
```python
def get_user():  # snake_case expected after "def"
    pass

class UserModel:  # PascalCase expected after "class"
    pass
```

:::note
These conventions only apply when there's actual ambiguity.
If an identifier already has a clear case style then it's always preserved.

### 2. File Context Analysis

First, Renamify analyzes the predominant case style in your file.
If a file uses mostly camelCase and the match starts with a lowercase letter,
ambiguous identifiers will be resolved as camelCase.

**Example:**
```javascript
// File with predominantly camelCase
function getUserName() { ... }
function setUserEmail() { ... }
const userId = 123;

// If we are replacing "api" here, it's likely camelCase
const api = new API();
```

### 3. Context from Other Related Files

If file-wide analysis isn't conclusive, Renamify looks at the preceding word
(e.g. `const`, `function`, `class`, etc.) and searches for other examples in the codebase
that have the same file extension. (This operation is performed only when needed and cached.)

### 4. Replacement String Preference

When no methods can provide a clear answer, Renamify defaults to the case style
of your replacement string.

**Example:**
```bash
# Replacing "config" with "settings_data" (snake_case)
# Found: .config (ambiguous)
# Result: .settings_data (uses snake_case from replacement)

# Replacing "config" with "settingsData" (camelCase)
# Found: .config (ambiguous)
# Result: .settingsData (uses camelCase from replacement)
```

## Important Constraints

Renamify **never** changes the fundamental character properties of a match:

- If a match starts with lowercase (like `api`), it can only be resolved to styles that also start with lowercase (snake_case, camelCase, kebab-case, lower)
- If a match starts with uppercase (like `API`), it can only be resolved to styles that also start with uppercase (PascalCase, Train-Case, SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE)

## Examples

### Example 1: Small Config File

```json
{
  "name": "myapp",
  "version": "1.0.0"
}
```

With few identifiers to analyze, Renamify falls back to the replacement string's style:
- Replacing `myapp` with `new_name` → uses snake_case
- Replacing `myapp` with `newName` → uses camelCase

### Example 2: Large TypeScript File

```typescript
class UserController {
  private userId: string;
  getUserData() { ... }
  updateUserProfile() { ... }
}
```

The file predominantly uses camelCase, so:
- `.config` would become `.configData` (camelCase) even if the replacement is `config_data`

### Example 3: Mixed Styles

When a file has no dominant style, Renamify defaults to the replacement string's style for maximum predictability.

## Overriding Ambiguity Resolution

You can always be explicit about the case style you want:

```bash
# Force specific styles only
renamify plan "api" "application" --only-styles snake,kebab

# Ignore ambiguous matches entirely
renamify plan "api" "application" --ignore-ambiguous
```

## Best Practices

1. **Be consistent** - Files with consistent case styles get better ambiguity resolution
2. **Use explicit styles** - When in doubt, use `--only-styles` to be explicit
3. **Preview first** - Always preview changes before applying them
4. **Test incrementally** - Apply changes to a subset of files first

## Technical Details

The ambiguity resolution system:
- Only activates for truly ambiguous cases
- Respects character constraints (uppercase/lowercase)
- Caches file analysis for performance
- Can be disabled with `--ignore-ambiguous`

This intelligent system ensures that Renamify makes sensible decisions about 95% of the time, while still giving you full control when needed.
