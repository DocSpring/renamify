description: Renamify's comprehensive safety mechanisms for worry-free renaming
---

Renamify is built with safety as a core principle. Multiple layers of protection ensure your code remains intact during renaming operations.

## Plan/Apply Workflow

### Two-Step Process
1. **Plan**: Generate a detailed preview of all changes without modifying anything
2. **Apply**: Execute the plan atomically after review

```bash
# Step 1: Create and review the plan
renamify plan old_name new_name --preview table

# Step 2: Apply when satisfied
renamify apply
```

### Fast Path for Simple Changes
The `rename` command combines planning and applying with confirmation:

```bash
renamify rename old_name new_name --preview table
# Shows preview → asks for confirmation → applies atomically
```

## Atomic Operations

All file modifications are atomic by default:

### How It Works
1. **Temporary files**: Changes are written to temporary files first
2. **Atomic rename**: Files are atomically renamed into place
3. **Directory sync**: Parent directories are synced (on Unix systems)
4. **Rollback on failure**: If any operation fails, all changes are rolled back

### Benefits
- **No partial states**: Your codebase never exists in a half-modified state
- **Interruption safety**: Safe to interrupt (Ctrl+C) during operations
- **Consistency**: All changes succeed together or none at all

## Backup and History System

### Automatic Backups
Before applying changes, Renamify creates backups of all affected files:

```
.renamify/
├── backups/
│   └── abc123-20241201-143022/
│       ├── src/
│       │   └── auth.js
│       └── components/
│           └── UserProfile.tsx
└── history.json
```

### Integrity Verification
- Each backup includes SHA-256 checksums
- Checksums are verified during restore operations
- Corrupted backups are detected and reported

### Unlimited Undo/Redo
```bash
# See all operations
renamify history

# Undo any operation by ID
renamify undo abc123

# Redo if you change your mind
renamify redo abc123
```

## Conflict Detection

Renamify detects various types of conflicts before making changes:

### File Rename Conflicts

**Multiple-to-One**: When multiple files would rename to the same destination
```
❌ Conflict detected: Multiple files would be renamed to 'utils.js':
  - old_utils.js
  - oldUtils.js

Use --exclude or --include patterns to resolve this conflict.
```

**Case-Insensitive Filesystems**: On macOS/Windows
```
⚠️  Case-insensitive rename detected: 'OldName.js' → 'oldName.js'
This will be handled with a two-step rename process.
```

**Windows Reserved Names**: Prevents creating invalid files
```
❌ Cannot create 'CON.js' - reserved filename on Windows
```

### Content Conflicts
- **Overlapping matches**: When the same text would be replaced multiple times
- **Boundary violations**: When matches don't respect word boundaries (with warnings)

## Lock File Protection

Renamify prevents concurrent operations that could corrupt your workspace:

### Lock Mechanism
- Lock file created at `.renamify/renamify.lock` during operations
- Contains process ID and timestamp for tracking
- Automatically cleaned up when operations complete

### Stale Lock Handling
- Stale locks (older than 5 minutes) are automatically removed
- Manual cleanup if needed: `rm .renamify/renamify.lock`

```bash
# If you see this error:
❌ Another renamify operation is in progress (PID: 12345)

# Check if the process is actually running:
ps 12345

# If not, remove the stale lock:
rm .renamify/renamify.lock
```

## Git Integration

### Status Checking
Renamify can check git status before operations:

```bash
# Apply with automatic git commit
renamify apply --commit
```

### Best Practices
- **Commit before large rename operations**: Makes git-based rollback possible
- **Clean working directory**: Start with committed changes when possible
- **Branch for experiments**: Use git branches for exploratory renaming

## Dry Run Mode

Preview changes without creating plan files:

```bash
# See what would change without any file creation
renamify dry-run old_name new_name --preview table
```

Perfect for:
- Exploring potential changes
- Testing include/exclude patterns
- Understanding scope before committing to a plan

## Error Handling

### Graceful Degradation
- **Permission errors**: Clear reporting with suggested fixes
- **Disk space**: Checks available space before large operations
- **Filesystem errors**: Detailed error messages with context

### Recovery Guidance
When operations fail, Renamify provides:
- **Clear error messages**: What went wrong and why
- **Recovery steps**: How to fix the issue
- **Safe cleanup**: How to return to a clean state

### Example Error Handling
```bash
❌ Error: Permission denied writing to 'src/readonly.js'

Suggestions:
1. Check file permissions: ls -la src/readonly.js
2. Make writable: chmod +w src/readonly.js
3. Or exclude from renaming: --exclude "src/readonly.js"
```

## Force Options (Use with Caution)

For advanced users who understand the risks:

```bash
# Apply even if conflicts are detected
renamify apply --force-with-conflicts

# Confirm case-insensitive or collision renames
renamify rename old new --confirm-collisions
```

**⚠️ Warning**: Force options bypass safety checks. Use only when you understand the implications and have backups.
