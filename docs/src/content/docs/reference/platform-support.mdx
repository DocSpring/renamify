description: Cross-platform compatibility and platform-specific considerations

Renamify is designed to work consistently across Linux, macOS, and Windows in the near future.
It handles platform-specific quirks intelligently.

## Supported Platforms

✅ **Linux** (x86_64)
✅ **macOS** (Intel and Apple Silicon)  
❌ **Windows** (x86_64) (coming soon)

## Case-Insensitive Filesystems

### macOS (APFS/HFS+)
Most macOS systems use case-insensitive filesystems. Renamify handles this by:

- **Automatic detection** of filesystem case sensitivity
- **Two-step renames** for case-only changes:
  1. `OldName.js` → `temp_12345.js`
  2. `temp_12345.js` → `oldName.js`
- **Conflict warnings** when case changes might cause issues

### Windows (NTFS)
Windows filesystems are typically case-insensitive. Renamify will provide:

- **Smart rename handling** similar to macOS
- **Reserved filename detection** (CON, PRN, AUX, NUL, COM1-9, LPT1-9)
- **Path length validation** (260 character limit without long path support)

### Linux (ext4/btrfs/etc.)
Most Linux filesystems are case-sensitive, allowing:

- **Direct renames** without intermediate steps
- **Full Unicode support** for international characters
- **No reserved filename restrictions**

## Path Handling

### Path Separators
Renamify accepts both forward slashes and backslashes:

```bash
# These are equivalent on Windows
renamify plan old new --include "src/**/*.js"
renamify plan old new --include "src\\**\\*.js"
```

### Path Length Limits

**Windows**: 260 characters by default
```bash
# Renamify detects and warns about long paths
❌ Error: Path too long for Windows: 
"C:\very\long\path\that\exceeds\260\characters\..."

Enable long paths or use shorter directory names.
```

**macOS/Linux**: Much higher limits (typically 4096+ characters)

### Unicode Support
Renamify fully supports Unicode filenames and content:

```bash
# Works with international characters
renamify rename 用户 profile --preview table
renamify rename josé maria --preview table
```

## Symbolic Links

### Behavior
- **Symlink files** can be renamed if their names match the pattern
- **Symlink targets** are never modified  
- **Directory traversal** does not follow symlinks by default

### Cross-Platform Differences

**Linux/macOS**:
- Full symlink support
- Can create and modify symlinks

**Windows**:
- Limited symlink support (requires admin privileges)
- Renamify handles gracefully without errors

## File Permissions

### Unix-like Systems (Linux/macOS)
```bash
# Renamify respects and preserves file permissions
ls -la before.js    # -rw-r--r--
renamify rename old new
ls -la after.js     # -rw-r--r-- (preserved)
```

### Windows
- Uses Windows ACLs appropriately
- Handles read-only files with clear error messages

## Performance Characteristics

### Linux
- **Fastest performance** due to efficient filesystem operations
- **Parallel directory traversal** scales well with CPU cores
- **Memory-mapped file I/O** for large files

### macOS
- **Good performance** with some filesystem overhead
- **APFS optimizations** for recent macOS versions
- **Slightly slower renames** due to case-insensitivity handling

### Windows
- **Adequate performance** with some Windows-specific overhead
- **NTFS optimizations** where possible
- **Antivirus interaction** may slow operations

## Known Platform Issues

### macOS
- **Unicode normalization**: macOS may normalize Unicode differently
- **Resource forks**: Very old HFS+ volumes may have resource forks (rarely an issue)
- **Spotlight indexing**: May temporarily slow file operations

### Windows
- **Antivirus scanning**: Real-time scanners may slow file operations
- **File locking**: Some editors/IDEs lock files more aggressively
- **Long path support**: Must be enabled in Windows 10+ for very long paths

### Linux
- **Case sensitivity**: Be careful when moving code between case-sensitive and case-insensitive systems
- **Filesystem differences**: Some network filesystems may have quirks

## Environment Variables

### Platform Detection
Renamify automatically detects platform capabilities:

```bash
# Force platform behavior (rarely needed)
RENAMIFY_PLATFORM=linux renamify plan old new    # Force Linux behavior
RENAMIFY_PLATFORM=windows renamify plan old new  # Force Windows behavior
```

### File System Override
```bash
# Force case sensitivity detection (expert use only)
RENAMIFY_CASE_SENSITIVE=true renamify plan old new
RENAMIFY_CASE_SENSITIVE=false renamify plan old new
```

## Best Practices by Platform

### Linux
```bash
# Take advantage of case sensitivity
renamify rename oldName OldName  # Works directly

# Use parallel processing for large projects
renamify plan old new --include "**/*.rs"  # Fast on Linux
```

### macOS
```bash
# Be aware of case insensitivity
renamify rename oldName OldName --preview table  # Shows two-step rename

# Consider filesystem overhead for huge projects
renamify plan old new --include "src/**" --exclude "node_modules/**"
```

### Windows
```bash
# Use forward slashes for consistency
renamify plan old new --include "src/**/*.js"

# Be mindful of path lengths
renamify plan old new --exclude "**/very/deeply/nested/directories/**"
```

## Cross-Platform Testing

For teams working across platforms:

```bash
# Test your refactoring on multiple platforms
git branch test-refactor
renamify rename old new --preview table
git commit -m "Test refactor"

# Have team members test on their platforms
git push origin test-refactor
```

## Platform-Specific Optimizations

### Planned Improvements
- **macOS**: Better APFS optimization
- **Windows**: Long path support detection and enablement
- **Linux**: io_uring support for faster file operations
- **All**: Platform-specific ignore patterns
