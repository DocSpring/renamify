title: renamify undo
description: Revert a previously applied renaming operation
---

The `undo` command reverts a previously applied renaming using the backup
system.

## Usage

```bash
renamify undo <ID>
```

## Arguments

- `<ID>` - History ID to undo (use `latest` for the most recent non-revert
  entry)

## Examples

```bash
# See recent operations
renamify history

# Undo a specific operation
renamify undo abc123-20241201-143022
```

## How It Works

1. **Locates backups** for the specified operation ID
2. **Verifies integrity** using stored checksums
3. **Restores original file contents** atomically
4. **Reverts file and directory renames** in reverse order
5. **Records undo operation** for potential redo

## Safety

- Uses the same atomic operations as apply
- Verifies backup integrity before restoration
- Can be undone with `renamify redo`
