title: renamify dry-run
description: Preview changes without saving a plan file
---

The `dry-run` command is an alias for `plan --dry-run`. It shows what would be changed without creating a plan file.

## Usage

```bash
renamify dry-run <OLD> <NEW> [OPTIONS]
```

This is equivalent to:
```bash
renamify plan <OLD> <NEW> --dry-run [OPTIONS]
```

## Use Cases

Perfect for:
- **Exploring potential changes** before committing to a plan
- **Testing include/exclude patterns** to see what files would be affected  
- **Understanding scope** of a refactoring operation
- **Quick previews** without cluttering your workspace

## Examples

```bash
# Quick preview of what would change
renamify dry-run getUserName fetchUserProfile

# Test specific paths
renamify dry-run old_name new_name src/ tests/

# Test include patterns
renamify dry-run old_name new_name --include "src/**/*.{js,ts}"

# See changes in diff format
renamify dry-run old_name new_name --preview diff
```

## Benefits

- **No files created** - Doesn't create `.renamify/plan.json`
- **Fast exploration** - Quick way to understand impact
- **Safe testing** - No risk of accidentally applying changes
