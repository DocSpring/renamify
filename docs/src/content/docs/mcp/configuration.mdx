The Renamify MCP server enables AI assistants like Claude Desktop, Cursor, and other MCP-compatible tools to perform intelligent renaming operations on your codebase.

## Prerequisites

<Steps>

1. **Install Renamify CLI** - The MCP server requires the renamify binary to be available:

   ```bash
   # Quick install (Linux/macOS)
   curl -fsSL https://docspring.github.io/renamify/install.sh | bash

   # Verify installation
   renamify --version
   ```

2. **Node.js 18+** - Required to run the MCP server via npx

</Steps>

## Configuration

### Claude Code

Run the following command to add the Renamify MCP server:

```bash
claude mcp add renamify -- npx -y @renamify/mcp-server
```

Claude Code loads MCP server settings from `~/.claude.json` or
from `.mcp.json` in the project root.

### Cursor

For Cursor, add to your workspace `.mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "renamify": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@renamify/mcp-server"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Codex CLI

Location: `~/.codex/config.toml`

OpenAI's [Codex CLI](https://openai.com/codex/) reads MCP configuration from this file.

```toml
[mcp_servers.renamify]
command = "npx"
args = ["-y", "@renamify/mcp-server"]
```

Restart Codex after saving the configuration file so the new MCP server is detected.

### Local Development

For day-to-day development we prefer running the TypeScript entrypoint through Bun so you get fast startup without rebuilding the dist bundle.
Make sure Bun is installed (`brew install bun` or see https://bun.sh/) and that you have already run `task mcp:deps` to install project dependencies.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "renamify": {
      "command": "bun",
      "args": ["run", "renamify-mcp/src/index.ts"]
    }
  }
}
```

If you want to test the published build, point your configuration at the compiled JavaScript instead:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "renamify": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["path/to/renamify-mcp/dist/index.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Environment Variables

The MCP server supports one environment variable:

### `RENAMIFY_PATH`

Specify a custom path to the renamify binary if it's not in your system PATH:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "renamify": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@renamify/mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "RENAMIFY_PATH": "/path/to/renamify"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

<Aside type="tip">

The MCP server will automatically detect renamify in your PATH. You only need to set `RENAMIFY_PATH` if:

- renamify is installed in a non-standard location
- You want to use a specific version
- You're testing a development build

</Aside>

## Verification

After configuration, restart your AI assistant and verify the connection:

1. **Claude Desktop**: Look for "renamify" in the MCP tools list
2. **Cursor**: Check the MCP panel for available tools
3. **Test the connection**: Ask the AI to "Check renamify status"

The AI should be able to call:

```
Tool: renamify_status
Arguments: {}
```

And receive information about the current renamify installation.

## Troubleshooting

### "Renamify CLI is not available"

The MCP server cannot find the renamify binary. Solutions:

1. **Install renamify**:

   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://docspring.github.io/renamify/install.sh | bash
   ```

2. **Set RENAMIFY_PATH** in your MCP configuration:

   ```json
   "env": {
     "RENAMIFY_PATH": "/usr/local/bin/renamify"
   }
   ```

3. **Verify installation**:

   ```bash
   which renamify
   renamify --version
   ```

### "MCP server not connecting"

1. **Check Node.js version**:

   ```bash
   node --version  # Should be 18.0.0 or higher
   ```

2. **Test npx directly**:

   ```bash
   npx @renamify/mcp-server
   ```

   You should see no output (the server waits for stdio input).

3. **Check configuration file location** - Ensure you're editing the correct config file for your platform.

### "Permission denied"

On Unix systems, ensure the renamify binary is executable:

```bash
chmod +x /path/to/renamify
```

## Security Considerations

<Aside type="caution">

The MCP server has full access to execute renamify commands in your filesystem. Only use it in trusted environments and be cautious when:

- Working with sensitive codebases
- Granting access to shared systems
- Using with untrusted AI prompts

</Aside>

The MCP server:

- Only executes renamify CLI commands
- Cannot execute arbitrary shell commands
- Respects all renamify safety features (atomic operations, undo/redo)
- Uses the summary output format by default (minimal data exposure)

## Advanced Configuration

### Multiple Workspaces

You can configure different renamify instances for different projects:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "renamify-project1": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@renamify/mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "RENAMIFY_PATH": "/projects/project1/bin/renamify"
      }
    },
    "renamify-project2": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@renamify/mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "RENAMIFY_PATH": "/projects/project2/bin/renamify"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Debug Mode

To debug MCP server issues, you can enable verbose logging in your AI assistant's developer tools or console output. The server uses stdio for communication, so errors will appear in the assistant's logs.
