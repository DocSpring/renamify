import { LinkCard, Steps, Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

The Renamify MCP Server enables AI assistants to perform intelligent, case-aware
renaming operations on your codebase.

## Quick Start

<Steps>

1. **Install Renamify CLI**

   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://docspring.github.io/renamify/install.sh | bash
   ```

2. **Setup MCP Server**

   Add this to your AI assistant's MCP configuration:

   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "renamify": {
         "command": "npx",
         "args": ["-y", "@renamify/mcp-server"]
       }
     }
   }
   ```

</Steps>

## What is MCP?

The **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is an open standard that enables AI
assistants to securely connect to external tools and data sources. The Renamify
MCP Server implements this protocol, allowing AI agents to:

- **Plan renames** with full case-awareness across your codebase
- **Preview changes** in AI-friendly formats before applying
- **Execute rename plans** atomically with built-in safety features
- **Manage history** with unlimited undo/redo capabilities

## Why Use the MCP Server?

- Purpose-built for AI agents with structured outputs and clear feedback
- Plan-first workflow ensures you review changes before applying
- Automatically handles all naming conventions in a single operation
- All changes succeed together or roll back completely

## Key Features

### Designed for AI Agents

The MCP Server provides structured, predictable outputs that AI agents can
easily parse and understand:

- **Summary format** optimized for AI consumption
- **Clear error messages** with actionable guidance
- **Consistent response patterns** across all tools
- **Helpful context** added to every operation

### Case-Aware Transformations

When you rename `getUserName` to `fetchUserProfile`, the MCP Server
automatically handles:

- `getUserName` → `fetchUserProfile` (camelCase)
- `get_user_name` → `fetch_user_profile` (snake_case)
- `GetUserName` → `FetchUserProfile` (PascalCase)
- `GET_USER_NAME` → `FETCH_USER_PROFILE` (SCREAMING_SNAKE)
- `get-user-name.js` → `fetch-user-profile.js` (file names)
- `user-name/` → `user-profile/` (directories)

### Safety Features

Every renaming operation includes multiple safety layers:

1. **Preview before apply** - See exactly what will change
2. **Atomic operations** - All changes succeed or none are applied
3. **Full history tracking** - Every operation can be undone
4. **Git integration** - Optional automatic commits
5. **Conflict detection** - Identifies and reports merge conflicts

## Available Tools

The MCP Server provides 10 specialized tools:

- [**renamify_search**](/renamify/mcp/tools#renamify_search) - Search for
  identifiers across your codebase
- [**renamify_plan**](/renamify/mcp/tools#renamify_plan) - Create a renaming
  plan with case-aware transformations
- [**renamify_apply**](/renamify/mcp/tools#renamify_apply) - Execute a plan to
  make the actual changes
- [**renamify_undo**](/renamify/mcp/tools#renamify_undo) - Revert a previously
  applied renaming
- [**renamify_redo**](/renamify/mcp/tools#renamify_redo) - Re-apply an undone
  renaming
- [**renamify_history**](/renamify/mcp/tools#renamify_history) - View past
  renaming operations
- [**renamify_status**](/renamify/mcp/tools#renamify_status) - Check current
  state and pending plans
- [**renamify_preview**](/renamify/mcp/tools#renamify_preview) - Review a plan
  in different formats
- [**renamify_rename**](/renamify/mcp/tools#renamify_rename) - Case-aware rename
  (plan + apply in one step)
- [**renamify_replace**](/renamify/mcp/tools#renamify_replace) - Simple
  regex/literal replacement without case transformations

## Installation Steps

<Steps>

1. **Install the Renamify CLI**

   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://docspring.github.io/renamify/install.sh | bash
   # or download from GitHub releases
   ```

2. **Configure your AI assistant**

   Add the Renamify MCP server using npx (no installation needed):

   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "renamify": {
         "command": "npx",
         "args": ["-y", "@renamify/mcp-server"]
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Start renaming!**

   Ask your AI assistant to use Renamify for renaming operations

</Steps>

## Example Workflow

Here's how an AI agent typically uses the MCP Server:

```
User: "Rename all instances of UserAccount to CustomerAccount in the src folder"

AI: I'll help you rename UserAccount to CustomerAccount. Let me start by creating a plan:

Tool: renamify_plan
Arguments: {
  "old": "UserAccount",
  "new": "CustomerAccount",
  "includes": ["src/**/*"],
  "preview": "summary"
}

Result:
Created plan: a3b7c9d4e8f2a6b1
Summary:
  Files to modify: 12
  Total replacements: 47
  Variants found: UserAccount (15), userAccount (18), user_account (8), USER_ACCOUNT (6)
  Files to rename: 3

The plan shows 47 replacements across 12 files. Would you like me to apply these changes?

User: "Yes, apply the changes"

AI: I'll apply the renaming plan now:

Tool: renamify_apply

Result: Successfully applied 47 replacements across 12 files and renamed 3 files
```
